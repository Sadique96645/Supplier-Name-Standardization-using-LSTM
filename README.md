Supplier Name Standardization using LSTM

The primary application for LSTM in spend analysis is vendor name normalization, whereby vendor names are predicted. Many large companies that constitute a large portion of your spend will hold various names within your various data systems.
Aggregating these names into a single name is important to show how much spend is going to certain suppliers so that you may identify your key suppliers.

For example,
[DELL FINANCIAL SERVICES, DELL MARKETING LP, DELL NV, DELLEMC, DMI DELL CORP BUS] Becomes DELL
[ORACLE, ORACLE AMERICA INC, ORACLE CORPORATION, ORACLE FINANCIAL SERVICES, ORACLE USA INC] becomes ORACLE
